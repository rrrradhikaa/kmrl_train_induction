# 🚆 RAILSPARK – AI-Driven Train Induction Planning & Scheduling for KMRL  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
**SIH 2025 – PS ID: 25081**  
Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) must decide every night which of its 25 four-car trainsets will:  
- Enter revenue service at dawn  
- Stay on standby  
- Move to the Inspection Bay Line (IBL) for maintenance  

This decision depends on interdependent factors such as **fitness certificates, mileage balancing, branding priorities, energy efficiency, and explainability**.

## 💡 Our Solution – *Intelligent Induction Automation*  
RAILSPARK is an **AI + Rules hybrid system** that automates daily induction planning by:  
- ✅ Automating train scheduling  
- ✅ Checking real-time train status  
- ✅ Balancing mileage and usage  
- ✅ Prioritizing branding requirements  
- ✅ Optimizing for energy & time savings  
- ✅ Delivering transparent, explainable decisions
